SQL Assignment: Extracting Insights from a Bookstore Dataset
Hey there! I‚Äôve just wrapped up an exciting SQL assignment where I got hands-on with a fictional bookstore dataset and extracted meaningful insights through structured queries. This exercise helped sharpen my SQL skills while solving real-world data exploration tasks.
‚úÖ What I Did
Using various SQL commands like SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and AGGREGATE functions, I tackled problems such as:
- Filtering books by genre and publication year
- Calculating total stock and tracking sales across genres and authors
- Identifying customer behavior based on geography and spending habits
- Ranking books by popularity and price within specific genres
- Estimating inventory and remaining stock after order fulfillment Sample Queries I Worked With
- Retrieve total stock available
- Find the most frequently ordered books


üéØ Key Learnings
- The power of JOIN to connect datasets and expose patterns across tables
- How grouping and aggregation reveal customer preferences and operational trends
- The importance of query optimization and clarity when dealing with business logic

üõ†Ô∏è This was a rewarding assignment for reinforcing database fundamentals and analytical thinking. Feel free to explore the repo and reach out if you'd like to chat data!
